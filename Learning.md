# Learning Markdown

Markdown is a markup language, it styles texts on a webpage, you can also add images, links, lists and so on. What make it special is its simplicity, you don't need to learn html to understand it, it is as easy as writing simple regular text!

If you want to edit your text, like bolding some words, you will need to add some non-alphabetic characters. Each one of those have a different use, I will mention bellow some of them:

1. Bold : write your word in between ** ** .
2. Italic: write your word in between * * .
3. Strikethrough: write your word in between ~ ~ .

you can visit this [link](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for more formatting styles.

To add Images to your website, you will need to copy its address then write on your md file the following syntax:
![image title] (image address). Similirly, to add a link use this syntax:
[link title] (your link).

As you see, markdown makes styling websites more enjoyable and easy to learn!
