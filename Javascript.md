 JavaScript is among the most powerful and flexible programming languages of the web. It powers the dynamic behavior on most websites. This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. 

**Linking to a JavaScript file from an HTML page**
 You can include JavaScript in your HTML in two ways:
 * Writing the code in your HTML
 * Including it as a link to an external file

 But it is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the .js extension.

 **JavaScript Syntax** 
  JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed.

  * *COMMENTS*:
    You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code. There are two ways to add a comment:
              1. Single comment: by adding " // " 
              2. Multi-line comment: by writting your comment in between " /*   */ " 

  * *VARIABLE*:

     variables are used to store data values. JavaScript uses the **var**  keyword to declare variables. An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.   
            For example: var sum = 0 ;

     Multiple data types can be stored in variables,  JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values. The example bellow shows how to store different data types in var :
                
                 var pi = 3.14;
                 var person = "John Doe";
                 var answer = 'Yes I am!';
