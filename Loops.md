## Comparsion Operators: 

![comp](https://cdn.javascripttutorial.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/JavaScript-Comparison-Operators.png)

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.
The following table describes the comparison operators:

 | Operator | Description |
|----: |---:|
| Equal (==)   |    Returns true if the operands are equal.   |
| Not equal !=   |  Returns true if the operands are not equal.     |
| Strict equal (===)    |   Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type.    |
| Strict not equal (!==)    | Checks if the operands are of the same type but not equal, and vise versa |
| Greater than (>)    |   Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.    |
| Greater than or equal (>=)    |  Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal the right |

## Logical Operators: 
Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values, The logical operators are described in the following table.

.

## Loops:

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. 

* For Loop
    A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
    ![for](https://tutorial.techaltum.com/images/javascript-loops.jpg)
    
    A for statement looks as follows:
           for ([initialExpression]; [condition]; [incrementExpression]) {
                statements
           }
    If the value of condition is true, the loop statements execute. If the value of condition is false, the for loop terminates.        

* While Loop
    A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.

    ![while](https://study.com/cimages/videopreview/videopreview-full/bnip2bj9ee.jpg)

    A while statement looks as follows:
            while (condition){
                  statements
                  }
    
    If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
