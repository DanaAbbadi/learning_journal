## Comparsion Operators: 

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.
The following table describes the comparison operators:

 | Operator | Description |
|----: |---:|
| Equal (==)   |    Returns true if the operands are equal.   |
| Not equal (!=)   |  Returns true if the operands are not equal.     |
| Strict equal (===)    |   Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type.    |
| Strict not equal (!==)    | Checks if the operands are of the same type but not equal, and vise versa |
| Greater than (>)    |   Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.    |
| Greater than or equal (>=)    |  Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal the right |

## Logical Operators: 
Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values, The logical operators are described in the following table.

## Loops:

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. 

* **For Loop**

    A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. <br/>


    ![for](https://tutorial.techaltum.com/images/javascript-loops.jpg) <br/>


    A for statement looks as follows: <br/>
    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  for ([initialExpression]; [condition]; [incrementExpression]) { <br/>
               &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  statements <br/> 
                &nbsp;  } <br/>
    If the value of condition is true, the loop statements execute. If the value of condition is false, the for loop terminates.        

* **While Loop** <br/>


    A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.


    ![while](https://study.com/cimages/videopreview/videopreview-full/bnip2bj9ee.jpg)


    A while statement looks as follows:<br/>
            &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; while (condition){<br/>
                          &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  statements<br/>
                      &nbsp;   }<br/>
    
    If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
