As you can see, a *growth mindset* revolves around the idea that you can improve ability and performance through effort and hard work. The opposite, a *fixed mindset*, refers to the belief that a person's abilities and talents are static. 

### How to keep yourself in a growth mindset: 
1. Mistakes and struggle are good for brain growth and brain strengthening.
2. It is always hard at the begining, but with more Don't  you will get better.
3. Don't compare yourself with others, and accept criticism!
