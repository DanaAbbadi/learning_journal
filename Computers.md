# How computers Work
![comp](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OAx_6-wdslM/maxresdefault.jpg)

A computer is a programmable device that stores, retrieves, and processes data. In other words, computers are electronic devices that accept data (input), process that data, produce output, and store (storage) the results. 
And that is excatly What makes a computer, a computer.

The beauty of a computer is that it can run a word-processing program one minuteâ€”and then a photo-editing program five seconds later. In other words, the computer can be reprogrammed as many times as you like. This is why programs are also called **software**. By contrast, a computer's **hardware** is the physical part of computer system or electronic device, the bits and pieces from which it is made (and the peripherals, like the mouse and printer). The hardware is what makes your computer powerful; the ability to run different software is what makes it flexible. That computers can do so many different jobs is what makes them so useful.

Computers use binary numbers to operate. Binary is the primary language for computers for the following reasons:

* It is a simple and elegant design.
* Binary's 0 and 1 method is quick to detect an electrical signal's off or on state.
* The positive and negative poles of magnetic media are quickly translated into binary.
* Binary is the most efficient way to control logic circuits.
