As you can see, The *selector* specifies which element or elements in the HTML page the CSS rule applies to. While the *declarations* within the block determines how the elements are formatted on a webpage. Each declaration consists of a property and a value separated by a colon (:) and ending with a semicolon (;), and the declaration groups are surrounded by curly braces {}. The property is the style attribute you want to format; for example you can change the padding, color, font , etc. 

## CSS Selectors

In CSS, selectors are patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style. Selectors are one of the most important aspects of CSS as they allow you to target specific elements on your web page in various ways so that they can be styled.
